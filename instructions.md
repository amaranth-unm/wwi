# Getting Started with Your Class Project Site

**Welcome!** This page guides you through setting up your own project folder in the repository you have forked the WWI repository. 

## What You Have

Amaranth has already set up this template with:
- A **homepage** that introduces the class project (`index.md`)
- **Sample essay folders** that show what an essay looks like
- An **essays folder** where you'll add your own essay
- All the styling and design already done for you

## Quick Start: Your First Steps

### Step 1: Open the Code Editor in Your Browser

The easiest way to edit your site is using GitHub's built-in code editor. **No need to download anything!**

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Press the **`.` (period) key** on your keyboard
   - This opens the code editor in your browser
   - You'll see all your files on the left side
3. You're now ready to edit!


### Step 2: Create Your Essay Folder

Your project needs its own folder. Here's how:

1. In the sidebar of the Code Editor, click on the `essays/` folder
2. Left-click to open the menu
3. Right-click `coal/` and select **Copy**
4. Right-click again on the `essays/` folder and select **Paste**
5. Rename that folder using **kebab-case** (lowercase with hypens, no spaces)
   - ✅ Good examples: `great-fermentation-debate`, `pigeon-conspiracy`, `hot-dog-sandwich`
   - ❌ Bad examples: `Great Fermentation Debate` (spaces), `GreatFermentationDebate` (not uncapitalized, no hyphens)
6. The new folder name is saved after you click off of it or hit enter

**What your folder structure will look like:**
```
essays/
├── your-essay-title/
│   ├── images/           (create this next)
│   └── index.md          (create this next)
```


## Your First Edits

### Update the Front Matter (Top of Your File)

At the very top of `index.md`, you'll see something like:

```yaml
---
title: Coal
layout: base
author: Your Name
date: 2026-01-01
header-image: images/coal-breaker.jpg
header-title: Coal
header-tier: banner
header-position: center
thumbnail: images/coal.jpg
summary: A collection of raw coal. 
geo: [47.4865, 102.4974]
placename: Mongolia
medium: 
object-date: 2022
collection: Wikimedia Commons
tags:
  - coal
  - energy
---
```

1. Change the `title` to match your actual project. 
2. Do not change the `layout`.
3. Change the `author` to to your name. 
4. Once you have images, you can change `header-image` and `thumbnail`. You do not need to change the other header fields.
5. For `summary` write a short sentence that will appear in the little card for the file.
6. For each object file, go to Google Maps and right-click on a location to get its coordinates. Then replace the numbers in `geo`. Keep only four decimal places.
7. Replace the `placename`.
8. Add at least two keywords for your `tags`.


### Add Your Content

Below the `---` lines, replace the sample content with your own writing, analysis, images, etc. Keep the same structure and formatting.


### Add Your Images

1. In the code editor, drag image files from your computer into your `images/` folder
2. Once uploaded, you can reference them in your `index.md` file by copy-pasting code such as in the following example:

```
{%raw%}
{% include images/figure.html
  class="right"
  width="40%"
  caption="What a nice view"
  alt-text="Color photograph showing some hiking trails in a canyon of the Sandia foothills."
  image-path="images/coal-1.jpg"
%}
{%endraw%}
```

**Image path tips:**
- A common error is when people type out the image path and accidentally make a typo
- Also, pay extra attention to the file type, since **jpg** is not the same a **jpeg**

**Image naming tips:**
- Use **lowercase only** (no capitals)
- Use **hyphens** between words, not spaces (e.g., `band-photo.jpg` not `band photo.jpg`)
- Make names **descriptive** (e.g., `stage-setup.jpg` instead of `photo1.jpg`)


## Editing Your Files

### How to Make Changes

1. Open the code editor in your browser (press `.` key)
2. Click the file you want to edit in the left sidebar
3. Type to make changes
4. Click on the flow chart icon on the left
5. Enter a brief message
6. Click the `Commmit & Push` button
7. You can watch the yellow circle spin in the Actions menu on your repository
8. If you get a green check, you're good!
9. If you get a red circle with an X, you must stop and investigate. Visit our [Troubleshooting page](https://amaranth.unm.edu/history-of-energy/docs/reference/troubleshooting.html) to help you figure out what to fix.


### Using Markdown

You don't need to know HTML! Just use simple **markdown** formatting:

```markdown
# This is a heading (H1)

## This is a subheading (H2)

**This text is bold**

*This text is italic*

[This is a link](https://example.com)

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3
```

**Tip:** Look at the sample pages in the `essays/` folder to see examples of markdown you can copy!


## Need Help?

### Ask Your Instructor

If something breaks or doesn't work:
- Email the helpful staff at [Amaranth](mailto:amaranth@unm.edu)
- Tell them what you were trying to do
- Share a screenshot if helpful


### Use AI Tools

You can ask AI assistants like Claude or ChatGPT:
- "How do I add an image to my markdown file?"
- "How do I add a new section to my essay?"
- "What's wrong with this code?" (paste your code and the error)
- "Can you write this text in markdown format?"


### Check the Xanthan Docs

For more advanced features:
- Browse the `/docs/` folder in your repository
- Visit [xanthan-web.github.io/xanthan/docs/](https://xanthan-web.github.io/xanthan/docs/)


## When You're Ready to Clean Up

Once you understand how to edit your site and you're happy with your project:

1. **Delete this file** (`instructions.md`)
   - Right-click it in the code editor and select "Delete"
2. **Remove it from navigation** (if your instructor set that up)
3. Keep your project folder and start adding your real content!
